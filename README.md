## [Interactive Live Lindenmayer System Editor](https://avashkattel.github.io/L-System-Editor/)

## Usage
- **Dynamic Rule Editor:** Easily add, edit, and remove L-System rules in a pop-up editor.
- **Controls:**

| Action | Mouse Interaction | Touch Interaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pan / Move** | `Left-Click` + Drag | `Two-Finger` Drag |
| **Zoom** | `Mouse Wheel` Scroll | `Two-Finger` Pinch |

- **Angle:** In degrees and dictates how much the "turtle" turns whenever it encounters a `+` (turn right) or `-` (turn left) command. Even a minuscule change in the angle can lead to a dramatically different structure. The **Play Angle** button animates this parameter with a step size of 0.05 degrees.
- **Iteration:** An L-System is a recursive process of string rewriting.
  - Iteration 0 begins with a simple initial string called the **Axiom** (e.g., `F`).
  - Iteration 1 is achieved by applying the **Rules** to every character in the axiom. For example, if the rule is `F -> F[+F]F[-F]F`, the `F` is replaced, and the new string becomes `F[+F]F[-F]F`.
  - Iteration 2: The rule is applied again to *every `F`* in the new string and the new string becomes `F[+F]F[-F]F[+F[+F]F[-F]F]F[+F]F[-F]F[-F[+F]F[-F]F]F[+F]F[-F]F`.
Each iteration exponentially increases the length of the string and the detail of the final structure. A non-blocking toast notification warns the user when setting an iteration count above 7, as higher iterations can be computationally intensive.

- How It Works
This application uses a classic "turtle graphics" approach to interpret the strings generated by the L-System. A "turtle" moves around a 2D canvas, following commands from the string to draw the structure.

| Symbol | Action                                     |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------- |
|  `F`   | Move forward by one step and draw a line.  |
|  `f`   | Move forward by one step without drawing.  |
|  `+`   | Turn right by the current angle `θ`.       |
|  `-`   | Turn left by the current angle `θ`.        |
|  `[`   | Push the turtle's current state to a stack. |
|  `]`   | Pop the state from the stack and return to it. |

By combining these simple commands with recursive rules, incredibly complex beautiful patterns emerge.
